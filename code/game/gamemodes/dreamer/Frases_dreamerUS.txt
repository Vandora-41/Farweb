Tell me about yourself.
You'll never be mine.
Put a knife in me!
Can you save my soul?
You know what we must do.
I'm proud of you.
Let's kill!
What's right is wrong. What's wrong is right. What's right is right and wrong. What's wrong is wrong and right.
HATE. LET ME TELL YOU HOW MUCH I'VE COME TO HATE YOU SINCE I BEGAN TO LIVE.
Let me escape.
I beg you, just remember!
Is it right to cut hearts out?
There is no one more dangerous than me.
Everything is not going to be OK.
Why are we alive?
Look at the mirror. There is something on your face.
Tell them that we made you do it. They will forgive you.
Even if you manage to wake up, you will return. Like you always do.
I've got a price to pay.
Fires burn.
Do you even know WHO listens to your prayers?
SUMMARIZE.
Only love can break your heart.
Murderer.
This is the dead land.
No blame.
Look inside me.
Everything has gone too far.
The carousel has stopped.
I'm hiding my pain from you.
WRITE DOWN ON A PAPER.
Curse them! Curse them! Curse them!
What a fool of heart, such a fool of heart...
Know, will.
I will cry at your grave.
I feel the pain of everyone. Then I feel nothing.
The way to awakening lies through the destruction of prejudices. They keep you bound to these lies.
Trey!
We're not moving.
You have the right to lie to me too.
I want to hug a child. I want to kill a child.
Your heart knows.
JUST DO IT!
Darkness, teeth are smiling.
I'm full of hatred and I want to kill!
You've made us alive!
Nothing matters but the end of matter.
<uns numero aleatorio nada a ver de 4 dÐ½gitos>
Show me your power.
Majesty and power! Majesty and power!
How long did you sleep?
Caring, Sympathy, Compassion.
I won't have kids anymore.
Your face is ugly.
Twenty three again.
Know, Chromosomes.
We are your friends.
Who are you, really?
I fucking hate these people.
Ordinary morality is only for ordinary people.
Look inside me.
Something weird is going to happen.
You're not evil. You'll meet the real evil before you die.
Praise me!
Who am I?
Why do you need to do anything?
Avoid speech.
I know who you are.
Sightless, unless the eyes reappear.
Do you enjoy what you do?
Rat's coat, crowskin, crossed staves in a field.
I don't want to lose you.
You don't deserve love.
We're really different.
Our dried voices, when we whisper together are quiet and meaningless as wind in dry grass.
Your childhood is disgusting.
I hate it here.
There's a gap where we meet, where I end and you begin.
I'm proud of you.
The eyes are not here, there are no eyes here!
Humble yourself.
Do you really know what to do?
You are not unique or special.
No one cares about you.
ME! ME! ME! ME! ME! ME!
A real hero. A real human being.
For Thine is the Kingdom!
Would you like kids?
It is still raining.
Mother, my body disgusts me.
Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law!
The universe equals zero.
Be decisive!
THIS IS NOT WHAT WE WERE MADE FOR!
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door.
If LIES are everywhere, then how to make a MATTER of conscience?
Why live in a DREAM when REALITY is so close?
One. Two. Three. Four. Five. SSSSSIX? Seven. Eight. Nine Ten. ONE. Two. Three. Four. Five? Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten!
Calculate your every move.
You are the only one expelled from paradise. It's a long way back home.
I believe in you!
Eyes open. Darkness.
Do you believe in god?
What a twist!
Everything is a smulation.
God created us to lead people in obedience to him.
What's inside of you?
Your lifestyle leads you to the grave.
I have a secret.
A man offered a serpent to the sun, and prayed for salvation. A woman offered a reed to the sun, and asked for joy.
Remember it!
Her mouth is full of honey.
Oh, there ain't no rest for the wicked.
I READ YOUR THOUGHTS!
I don't like you.
Please, talk to us.
Humans are worthless.
You're disgusting.
Body to body. Flesh to flesh.
You are not insane. You are not insane. You are not insane. You are not insane. You are not insane.
You want to know why I hate you?
Save all your kisses for me!
At least, I'm better than you.
I have a body of a pig.
There's no question of why.
Don't tell them that I talk to you, otherwise you will feel pain once again.
Do I bother you?
It's time to wake up. Do you hear me? Wake up!
Beautiful! How beautiful you are!
Something is wrong.
These numbers. Summarize them and write them down.
In my talons, I shape clay, crafting life forms as I please. If I wish, I can smash it all.
Do you like hurting other people?
I have feelings.
I FEEL PAIN!
Despair will hold a place in my heart, a bigger one that you do do do.
He's coming! He's coming! Run!
Raping the slave.
I am your Sun!
We taught him how to feel. It was an accident.
Where will you sow your poison? What would the crops be?
