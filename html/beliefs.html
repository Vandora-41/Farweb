<TITLE>Faith and Devotion</TITLE><BR><span class='bheader'>Post-Christianity</span><BR><i>God is Hell.</i><BR><span class='fondheader'>The Keys </span><BR><BR><table><tr class='text2'><td> • Nothing has rejected what Nothing was not, and it was a word. The word was GOD. </td></tr><tr class='text1'><td> • By rejecting everything the God was not, He became guilty of the Universe. He did not create skies nor planets, but he casted them  like a man casts a shadow. By denying everyone who He wasn't and everything He couldn't be, the Lord became the reason of Angels and the seed of life. </td></tr><tr class='text2'><td> • Angels are anti-image of God. Breeding nothingness, in which His silhouette looms. By multiplying, they've multiplied life, meaning and laws, inventing the good and evil. </td></tr><tr class='text1'><td> • Angels and animals did not know any compassion, but they felt fear and pain - and any pain feels like the world for it's victim. God was unlike them. He felt empathy towards their pain, crushed by it with in a divine torment only He is capable of. </td></tr><tr class='text2'><td> • However strong His agony was, He himself still was the Law. By force, he retracted as many angels, souls and animals as he could back inside, to make them merge with Him. His suffering was lessened as they've dissolved in him and their pain is gone. But being less of himself, he began to drown into Coma. </td></tr><tr class='text1'><td> • Coma is a process that is reverse to Godbirth, a gradual intergrowth of God and Nothing. </td></tr><tr class='text2'><td> •  Man is created by angels in the moment of their dissolution in God - he made in His and Their images at the same time. That is why mankind is doomed to be miserable. </td></tr><tr class='text1'><td> • The Appearance of Christ is a gleam of agonizing God's mind. After collecting the pain of his people in himself, Christ has managed to invoke compassion of enormous number of people, so the torture has bypassed the Lord without claiming His senses, making his burden a little less heavy. </td></tr><tr class='text2'><td> • For thousands of years Exoteric christianity has healed God's wounds, but then the teaching has begun to fade out. </td></tr><tr class='text1'><td> • And then new kind of Christs arrived - evil dictators, their fanatics and millions of innocent victims, all together secretly focused in a world-saving conspiracy of pity and compassion. And these Appearances were not the last... </td></tr><tr class='text2'><td> • After death, a man's soul flows into God, and God becomes Hell for him, for the man became the one with the Lord, stuck between the torture and the oblivion. </td></tr><tr class='text1'><td> • We have to save God so he cold save us. If God will continue to consume angels and decay, eventually we'll also become Nothing, simultaneously being the God. This moment of theurgical singularity is more painful and lasts longer than everything that our Lord himself could imagine with His endless mind. </td></tr><tr class='text2'><td> •  Prayers, rituals, religious thoughts and living a pious life devoted to God is the way for a man to both separate himself from God-in-Coma and relieve His burden. By saving the Lord and saving himself from the Lord, a man can reach the Exclusion  - the blessing of the final non-divinity through un-making his psyche and becomming the Angelic Heaven: a soulless, thoughtless and timeless existence as afterdeath matter. </td></tr><tr class='text1'><td> • The Grey Church priests help the flock by collecting the rot and fat of their souls during confessions, and handing the sins to their ecclesial superiors. The reason for this is forbidden to know. </td></tr></table><BR><BR><BR><span class='bheader'>Thanati</span><BR><i>'Transmutation through Death.'</i><BR><BR><span class='fondheader'>The Keys</span><BR><table><BR><tr class='text2'><td> •  Our Multiverse is a bleak and miserable place.

When a truly living being reaches death, it's soul goes to the Shadow which is casted by reality.</td></tr><tr class='text1'><td> •  In the Shadow - 'world of spirits', divided from the world of living by the Shroud, souls have limited abilities, and their stay is short.</td></tr><tr class='text2'><td> •  A strong soul could be reborn in a new material form, but a weak one will surrender. It will descend into a pseudo-reality, thus losing all possibility of return to the real world.</td></tr><tr class='text1'><td> •  These pseudo-realities, called Reflections, are creations of souls. Reflections are based on their memories, beliefs and scrappy knowledge of the world they lived in before.</td></tr><tr class='text2'><td> •  Every Reflection casts a Shadow like the Original World does, and it is always possible to descend to a deeper Reflection.</td></tr><tr class='text1'><td> •  By filling a Reflection with their impressions and thoughts - which are mostly devoted to the death and  suffering before it, souls unwittingly make it a dangerous and depressive place. Their hidden fears and superstitions, even the most absurd, become real.</td></tr><tr class='text2'><td> •  Memories of the real world are becoming more and more dull with each Descent. Second Reflection is more simplified, scary and unsafe than the First, and so on.</td></tr><tr class='text1'><td> •  As for us, we've been dead for long, and we are in the fourth of seven Reflections. We already failed to achieve rebirth through suffering to hold our ground in the Reality and the previous Reflections.</td></tr><tr class='text2'><td> •  We must stay in the Fourth Reflections at least: it is a Heaven compared to the next Reflections. There is nothing but emptiness and pure suffering in the Seventh Reflection.</td></tr></table><BR><BR><span class='fondheader'>Dead Gods</span><BR>The strongest of lost souls are called Gods.

Quasi-living profit by it, pleasing the passion of a god they choose, and gaining his help in reward.<BR><BR><span class='loom'>Veles</span> is the supreme god - but not because of age or strength.
