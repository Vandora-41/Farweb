A lot of necessary functionality was stripped from this codebase to avoid leaking credentials. You will need to write your own replacement for these.

Some optional functionality was made to work with Farweb's Discord server and other backend bots and webservers that communicate via HTTP. These are not available, and you will need to write your own if you want that same optional functionality.

The database schema for Farweb is not available. You will need to figure it out on your own, or rewrite my shoddy DB code.
